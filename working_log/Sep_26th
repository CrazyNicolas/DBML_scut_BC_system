zeyuan Ma:
    1.update the rpc invocation in the rpc_sample.go
    2.update rsa_utils.go with the publickey and privatekey generator and getter
mingze Sun:
    1.summarize again the PBFT process, solve the problem (why the prepare and the commit process are so same)
        reason is (1) the prepare process is, as a node visual angle, this system is reliable.
        another reason is (2) the commit process is, as system visual angle, this system possesses enough nodes trustworthy.
    2.find out what concrete function invoked in every process and what structure is in every process
    3.another thing is to be done, draw a concrete process model picture in every process.

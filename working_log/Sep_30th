today we discuss a main idea about how to use theories to compare traditional ML and our
DBML:
    1.how to use rpcx to efficiently implement complex communication within a bc system
    2.How those advanced computation(matrix , differential , gradient , for-loop ,..) are implemented by cpu and other compositions in computer
    3.In a complex network , how to estimate the communication cost under the given structure , especially
    we prefer to take the network as a blackbox and consider the duration between some transaction get in and get out.
    4.tensorflow's way to calculate for those advanced computation
    5.How to analyse the ability of cpu using its technical parameters
